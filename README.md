# ClassTree

tool for php code analysis. The goal is to create a class diagram.

I called "Tree" but you know usually code is not exactly like a binary tree. Often you have a more than one base clases and interfaces and some objects may use many of them at the same time. This is going to complicate things RSN.

I apologize for mixing Spanish and English, will switch it entirely to English ASAP (read: while I refactor).
