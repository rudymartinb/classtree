-----------------------------
from the root of the project:

bin: contains classtree.php and running script.
src: contains all the production code
tests: test suite and tests cases
scripts: install and test suite runner scripts. testphp.sh is a generic script while runtests.sh is intended to be run from the root dir of the project.
fonts: just some basic fonts avaliable on the net.
documentation: 
	last_commit.txt is used when the runtests.sh commits to git.
	progress.txt: some of my thoughts

-----------------------------
from root/src:

src: classes which handle source code scanning and data tree building
diagram: classes to handle graphic generation 
include.php: contains all the require_once() directives used by the test suite and classtree.php
permutation.php: Not used yet but I might use it later when dealing with classes and interfaces to find the minimum optimal distance among them to avoid lots of lines crossing each other.

-----------------------------
from root/tests:

diagram: tests for the classes under diagram namespace
src: tests for the classes under src namespace
microtests: a bunch of small scope tests. special mention is syntax.php which allows you to test php code while running the tests with runtests.sh (on scripts dir)

dummy: some .php example files left for specific tests
